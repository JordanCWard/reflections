What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Initializing a repository means creating a repository for the first time. Without doing this, you wouldn't be able to save commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  Working directory is all of the files in the current directory.
  Staging area is where you place files before they go into a commit in the repository.
  It's useful because you can place multiple files here to put them in the same commit.
