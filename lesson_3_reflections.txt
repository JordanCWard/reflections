When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  Making a respository on github is useful for collaborating with others. Multiple people can edit the same respository online and everyone can see the changes and add to them. Also, you don't need to make all the changes on the same computer if you keep them online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If multiple people update the file at the same time, you want to pull the changes when it's relevant and useful to do so. If it always stays up-to-date, then it could update your files while you're working on them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches are different parts of a project. The master branch is the original branch and every other branch comes off it. It's useful to copy and edit parts of the project instead of the entire thing. This would be a branch off the master branch.
    Forks and clones are basically identical. Clones are local, forks are copying other people's material on github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can continue working on it offline.
